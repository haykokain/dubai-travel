   <div class="popoxutyunner"> <span class="esimuje"  id="text-focus-in">Dubai is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, the most populated of the 7 emirates of the United Arab Emirates. 
    Established in the 18th century as a small fishing village, the city grew rapidly in the early 21st century with a focus on tourism and luxury, having the second most five-star hotels in the world, 
    and the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which is 828 metres tall. In the eastern Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf, it is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo. 
    Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a major mercantile hub. A centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy relies on revenues from 
    trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. Oil production contributed less than 1 percent of the emirate's GDP in 2018. The city has a population of around 3.49 million.
    Many theories have been proposed as to the origin of the word "Dubai". One theory suggests the word used to be the souq in Ba. An Arabic proverb says "Daba Dubai", meaning "They came with a lot of money.
    " According to Fedel Handhal, a scholar on the UAE's history and culture, the word Dubai may have come from the word daba, which means "to creep",
     referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland. The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word, but to its alternative meaning of "baby locust" due to the abundance of locusts 
     in the area before settlement.</span> </div>
